VIX DATA PREPROCESSING SUMMARY
Generated: 2026-02-14
Feature: VIX (Attempt 1)
================================================================================

DATA SOURCES
------------
Primary: FRED VIXCLS (VIX Closing Price)
Fallback: Yahoo Finance ^VIX (not used - FRED successful)
Fetch script: src/fetch_vix.py

DATE RANGE
----------
Target range: 2015-01-30 to 2025-02-12 (matching base_features schema_freeze)
Actual range: 2015-01-30 to 2025-02-12 ✓
Total rows: 2,619

Note: Row count (2,619) exceeds base_features (2,523) because VIX includes all
trading days while gold may have different trading calendar. This is expected
and will be handled during feature generation by date-based merge.

DATA QUALITY CHECKS
-------------------
✓ PASS: No gaps > 3 consecutive days (max gap: 3 days)
✓ PASS: Missing data < 2% (0% missing for vix and vix_log_change)
✓ PASS: VIX values in reasonable range [8, 90] (actual: 9.14 to 82.69)
✓ ACCEPTABLE: 3 extreme log-changes (|change| > 0.5) - real market events
  - 2018-02-05: VIX 37.32 (Volmageddon)
  - 2024-08-05: VIX 38.57 (Carry trade unwind)
  - 2024-12-18: VIX 27.62 (FOMC policy shift)
✓ PASS: Date range alignment with schema_freeze
✓ PASS: Log-change calculation verified (max error < 1e-8)

PREPROCESSING STEPS COMPLETED
------------------------------
1. Fetched VIXCLS from FRED (2014-10-01 to 2026-02-12, 2,967 rows)
2. Sorted by date and handled missing values (forward-fill up to 3 days)
3. Computed log-changes: log(VIX_t) - log(VIX_t-1)
4. Filtered to target date range (2015-01-30 to 2025-02-12)
5. Verified data quality against design specification
6. Saved to data/processed/vix_processed.csv

OUTPUT FILES
------------
Raw data:        data/raw/vix.csv
Processed data:  data/processed/vix_processed.csv
Metadata:        data/processed/vix_metadata.json
Fetch script:    src/fetch_vix.py

COLUMNS
-------
1. date          - Trading date (datetime)
2. vix           - VIX closing level (float)
3. vix_log_change - log(VIX_t) - log(VIX_t-1) (float)

STATISTICS
----------
VIX Level:
  Mean:   18.22
  Median: 16.27
  Std:    7.23
  Min:    9.14
  Max:    82.69
  Q1:     13.34
  Q3:     21.27

VIX Log-Change:
  Mean:   -0.000063 (near-zero drift, as expected)
  Median: -0.004715
  Std:    0.078491 (~7.8% typical daily volatility)
  Min:    -0.330681 (-28% single-day drop)
  Max:    0.768245  (+116% single-day spike, 2018-02-05 Volmageddon)
  Autocorrelation (lag 1): -0.0522 (low, confirming mean-reverting behavior)

DESIGN COMPLIANCE
-----------------
✓ Daily frequency data (no interpolation artifacts like real_rate)
✓ No missing values after preprocessing
✓ Log-transform applied for HMM input normalization
✓ Date range matches base_features schema
✓ VIX statistics align with expected range (long-term mean ~18-20)
✓ Extreme events identified and documented (not removed - real data)

NEXT STEPS
----------
1. Pass to datachecker for standardized 7-step validation
2. If datachecker PASS: builder_model generates Kaggle training script
3. Training will use this data to generate 3 submodel outputs:
   - vix_regime_probability (HMM)
   - vix_mean_reversion_z (rolling z-score)
   - vix_persistence (rolling autocorrelation)

NOTES
-----
- VIX data is cleaner than real_rate (daily frequency, no interpolation)
- Extreme spikes are documented market events, not data errors
- Row count difference from base_features is expected (calendar alignment)
- Log-change autocorrelation of -0.052 confirms mean-reverting dynamics
  (consistent with VIX theoretical properties)

READY FOR DATACHECKER: YES
