  "objective": "Improve the options_market submodel by reducing output dimensionality. Attempt 1 demonstrated strong information content (Gate 2 MI +17.12%, VIF 2.12, all stability checks passed) but failed Gate 3 on all criteria. The 3-column output added noise that degraded XGBoost generalization. Reduce to 1-2 output columns to preserve signal while eliminating noise.",

    "attempt_1_results": {
      "gate1": "PASS - No all-NaN, no constant output, autocorrelation 0.77-0.89 (well below 0.99)",
      "gate2": "PASS - MI increase +17.12% (strong), VIF max 2.12 (excellent), stability max 0.146 (passes)",
      "gate3": "FAIL - All 3 criteria failed: DA -1.05%, MAE +0.018, Sharpe -0.234. DA degraded in ALL 5 folds. MAE improved in only 2/5 folds. Sharpe improved in only 1/5 folds."

    "root_cause_analysis": "The 3-column output gives XGBoost extra dimensions to split on without proportional signal. options_risk_regime_prob is clearly the most informative (rank #2, MI 0.031), while options_tail_risk_z has very low MI (0.002) and may be pure noise. Pattern matches real_rate attempts 4-5 where more columns = more noise.",
    "improvement_direction": "Reduce output to 1 column (regime_prob only) or 2 columns at most. If keeping 2, use options_risk_regime_prob + options_skew_momentum_z (higher MI than tail_risk_z). Alternatively, apply PCA to compress 3 columns into 1 principal component."
