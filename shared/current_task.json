The regression model has 96% bullish bias -- it almost always predicts UP. In 2026 YTD, it correctly predicted 21/31 days overall but caught only 1/10 down days. A classification XGBoost using the SAME 24 features failed completely (P(UP) always 0.46-0.51, zero discrimination). The problem is that the existing 24 features do not contain enough DOWN-specific information.
