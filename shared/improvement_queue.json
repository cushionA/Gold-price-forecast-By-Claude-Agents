      "description": "Reduce output from 3 columns to 1-2. options_risk_regime_prob ranked #2/22 in feature importance (5.70%) and has the highest individual MI (0.031). Consider: (1) output only regime_prob as single column, or (2) PCA to compress 3 columns into 1 principal component, preserving maximum variance while reducing noise. The 3-column output introduced noise that degraded DA in all 5 folds.",
      "reason": "Gate 2 PASS (MI +17.12%, VIF 2.12, stability 0.146) confirms information exists. Gate 3 FAIL with DA degraded in 0/5 folds improved and Sharpe degraded by -0.234. Pattern matches real_rate attempts 4-5 where more output columns gave XGBoost more noise to overfit on.",
