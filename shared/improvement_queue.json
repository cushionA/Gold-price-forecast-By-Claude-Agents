      "description": "Increase prediction magnitude spread to improve HCDA separation. Current prediction std (0.167) is only 18.7% of actual std (0.896). Options: (a) Post-hoc Platt scaling / isotonic regression calibration on validation set, (b) Add magnitude-aware term to Optuna objective that penalizes excessive prediction compression, (c) Reduce regularization slightly to allow wider prediction range while monitoring overfitting gap.",
      "reason": "HCDA at top-20% is 55.26% but top-10% is 60.53%. The prediction magnitude is too compressed, making the 80th percentile threshold non-discriminating. Better magnitude calibration would push the HCDA above 60%.",

      "type": "confidence_asymmetry",
      "description": "Address asymmetric directional accuracy. UP predictions achieve 61.8% accuracy vs DOWN predictions at 53.9%. Consider: (a) Separate confidence thresholds for UP vs DOWN, (b) Regime-aware confidence gating where HCDA thresholds adapt to VIX regime or trend regime probability, (c) Weight DOWN-direction training samples more heavily.",
      "reason": "The model is significantly better at calling bullish moves than bearish ones. DOWN-direction high-confidence predictions drag the combined HCDA below 60%.",

      "description": "Increase HCDA weight in Optuna composite objective. Current: Sharpe 50%, DA 30%, MAE 10%, HCDA 10%. Proposed: Sharpe 35%, DA 25%, MAE 10%, HCDA 30%. Also consider adding an overfitting penalty for HCDA (train-val HCDA gap > 15pp triggers penalty).",
      "reason": "HCDA was the lowest-weighted metric in the composite objective (10%) but is the only failing target. Increasing its weight in optimization should directly improve this metric.",
