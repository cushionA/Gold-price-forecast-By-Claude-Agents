      "reason": "Gate 2 stability fails by only 0.006 (0.1555 vs 0.15). EMA smoothing is the most direct fix with minimal risk to existing MAE performance. Cross-asset submodel had identical issue (stability 0.156) that smoothing would have addressed.",

      "reason": "Gate 2 MI fails by only 0.04pp (4.96% vs 5%). Reducing from 3 to 1 column lost MI (17.12% -> 4.96%). A single complementary directional signal should recover MI above 5% without reintroducing the noise from attempt 1's tail_risk_z and skew_momentum_z.",

    "root_cause": "Single column output has marginal MI (4.96%) and marginal stability (0.1555). Regime probability alone captures risk level but not direction. DA and Sharpe remain negative because the feature helps MAE (error reduction) but does not provide directional edge.",

      "MI decreased from 17.12% (3 cols) to 4.96% (1 col) -- expected but now below threshold",
      "Stability 0.1555 is inherent to raw HMM outputs (regime switches are abrupt)",
      "DA improved from -1.05% (attempt 1) to -0.24% (attempt 2) -- trend is positive but still negative",
